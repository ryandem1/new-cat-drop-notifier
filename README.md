# New Cat Drop Notifier
Notifier that can send a text message when the Oregon Humane Society drops a new batch of cats available for adoption.

This was designed to be run on a schedule from a Google Cloud Run job. It uses a bucket in Google Cloud Storage to persist a list of cats between runs to identify if there are new cats.
